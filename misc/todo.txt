Todo:
:vencode:
Bug: encodes that use x265-8/10/12.exe have incorrect output resolutions, esp 1080p/480p (1.9-r3 and 1.9-r15 tested) -not sure how to fix
Bug: files containing only video without any audio streams do not produce output.
Quality: test on 32-bit OS systems
Rewrite: vEncode.bat should support multi-track audio natively.
Rewrite/Bug: when copying audio, check to see if it's mp4 compatible using ffprobe.exe (increases dependencies)
Bug: Figure out why h265 12-bit yuv444p doesn't work.
Bug: Files with ! or & in the name error out (cannot parse/fix due to reserved character in CLI) -won't fix

:aencode:
Rewrite/Bug: Should preserve audio metainfo (language) if one was specified for Matroska containers



When using x265.exe, why does yuv444p produce smaller file sizes than yuv422p, on par with yuv420p?
Code: "In 444, chroma gets twice as much resolution, so halve quality when psy-rd is enabled" p->cbqpOffset +=6;
Reason: "This is primarily a visual quality improvement/psy-rd hack. In 444, since chroma resolution is on par 
with luma, and our eyes arent very sensitive to chroma, we increase the chroma QP so that those bits can be used 
up in luma." -Deepthi Nandakumar from Multicore mid-2014
When using mediainfo this shows up as: cbqpoffs=6 / crqpoffs=6   (instead of cbqpoffs=0 / crqpoffs=0 for yuv420p/yuv422p)

"x264 already gives +6 to chroma QP offset in 4:4:4 mode. This is completely arbitrary and probably not an ideal choice." -Dark Shikari 2013
