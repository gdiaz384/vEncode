Todo:
:vencode:
Rewrite: Inconsistent if audio will be present in final container. Audio should be done in 1 section.
Rewrite: Add audio support (1 track only) but incl opus (will not fit into mp4, default to mkv instead)
Bug: Figure out why 12-bit yuv444p doesn't work.
Bug: Files with & in the name error out (cannot parse/fix due to reserved character in CLI)

:aencode:
quality: test more, especially multi audio files
Rewrite: use bin\ executables instead of assuming enviornmental path
Rewrite: require audio codec instead of defaulting to one (or at least require "y" key press)
